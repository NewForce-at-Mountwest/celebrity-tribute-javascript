# Celebrity Tribute (JavaScript Edition)

# NewForce Tribute Agency

Your clients were so happy with the last website you built for them that they've asked you to build them another, similar website about a different celebrity. The requirements are almost exactly the same, except this time you should use JavaScript to build your HTML components and insert them into the DOM.

You should start by copying and pasting the following boilerplate code between the `body` tags of your `index.html` file:

```html
    <nav>
      <a href="#executive-summary">Executive Summary</a>
      <a href="#personal">Personal</a> 
      <a href="#news-feed">News Feecd</a>
      <a href="#career">Career</a>
    </nav>

    <section id="executive-summary"></section>
    <section id="personal"></section>
    <section id="news-feed"></section>
    <section id="career"></section>
    <footer id="footer"></footer>
```

Your job is to use JavaScript to:
- Build HTML strings with the content listed below
- Insert those HTML strings into the corresponding sections in the DOM

Keep in mind:
- Your objective for this group project is to practice JavaScript, not produce a super awesome web page. 
- You should challenge yourself to incorporate what you've learned so far (functions, loops, conditionals, etc) wherever possible.
- Save styling for last!
